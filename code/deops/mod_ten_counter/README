-- Making the executables --

Make for Windows using the following command:
make -f makefile-windows

Make for Linux using the following command:
make -f makefile-linux


-- Notes on mod_ten_counter --
Here is a snippet from the makefile (linux version):
#
# Link into one of the deoptimized versions
#
mod_ten_counter_deop: mod_ten_counter_main.o mod_ten_counter_deop.o
    gcc $(CLINKFLAGS) mod_ten_counter_deop.o mod_ten_counter_main.o -o mod_ten_counter_deop

#
# Link into the optimized version
#
mod_ten_counter_op: mod_ten_counter_main.o mod_ten_counter_op.o
    gcc $(CLINKFLAGS) mod_ten_counter_op.o mod_ten_counter_main.o -o mod_ten_counter_op

Notice that mod_ten_counter_main.o (built from mod_ten_counter_main.c) is being 
linked into both the Optimized and Deoptimized versions.  Thus, we will be 
building one executable for each version. How can we do this?  Well, this C 
code needs to be the same for both.  Also, it expects the function name to be 
the same whether within the optimized or deoptimized version.

To see, this notice the following.

From mod_ten_counter_main.c:
#ifdef _WIN64
void mod_ten_counter( int*, int*, int ) __attribute__((cdecl));
#elif _WIN32
void mod_ten_counter( int*, int*, int ) __attribute__((cdecl));
#elif __linux__
void _mod_ten_counter( int*, int*, int );
#endif

From mod_ten_counter_deop.asm:
	global  _mod_ten_counter	; Declare the name of this function

	section .text
_mod_ten_counter:
	push    ebx                     ; Preserve ebx

From mod_ten_counter_op.asm:
	global  _mod_ten_counter	; Declare the name of this function

	section .text
_mod_ten_counter:
	push    ebx                     ; Preserve ebx

From the snippet within mod_ten_counter_main.c, you can see that it simply 
expects the function to have a certain name.  It doesn't matter whether 
that function has been deoptimized or not.  It must only have a certain 
name.  As you can see from both versions of the assembly code, both
the optimized and deoptimized versions have the same name.  This is 
fine since we will never try to link these into the *same* executable; 
instead, they will always be linked into their own executable.


-- Running --

This will run the command on node 10 and restrict the version_tester.exe to 
core 2.  Within the config, taskset is used to restrict processes to core 3.
